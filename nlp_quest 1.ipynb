With the help of NLP, healthcare providers can quickly and accurately identify patterns and insights from patient data. For example, NLP can predict patient outcomes, such as the likelihood of readmission or the risk of developing a particular condition. NLP can also be used to extract key information from medical imaging reports. An example can be the size and location of tumours. This can help healthcare providers make more informed treatment decisions. Overall, NLP is a powerful tool that can help improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of care in the healthcare industry.'\n",
